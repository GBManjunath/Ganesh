        "Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) is a machine learning technique that builds an ensemble of weak learners (usually decision trees) in a stage-wise manner. Each new model is trained to correct the residual errors (differences between the predicted values and actual values) made by the previously trained models. The \"gradient\" in Gradient Boosting comes from the gradient of the loss function, which guides the optimization process. Gradient Boosting Regression is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict continuous values.\n",

        "A weak learner in Gradient Boosting is typically a model that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In practice, the weak learners are often shallow decision trees (also called \"decision stumps\"), which are trees with only one split.

Over many iterations, these weak learners are combined to form a powerful predictive model.\n",

        "The intuition behind Gradient Boosting is that rather than training a single model on all data, we build an ensemble of weak models that focus on the mistakes made by the previous models. Gradient Boosting works by iteratively training a series of models to predict the residual errors (the difference between the true values and the current model's predictions). The new models improve the predictions of the ensemble, and the final prediction is the weighted sum of all the models.\n",

        "Q6. How does the Gradient Boosting algorithm build an ensemble of weak learners?\n",
        "In Gradient Boosting, the algorithm builds an ensemble of weak learners in a sequential manner:\n",

        "Start with an initial model: The first model can be a simple one, like predicting the mean of the target variable.\n",
        "Iteratively train weak learners: In each iteration, a weak learner is trained on the residual errors of the previous model. These residuals are the difference between the actual target values and the predictions made by the current ensemble.\n",
        "Update the predictions: The model's predictions are updated by adding the contribution of the new weak learner, scaled by the learning rate.\n",
        "Repeat: The process is repeated until a predefined number of weak learners are trained or the model performance improves sufficiently.\n",
