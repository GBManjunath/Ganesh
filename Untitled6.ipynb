        "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of more than one part of a program to maximize the efficiency of a CPU. It allows multiple threads (smaller units of a process) to run independently but share the same resources, such as memory, file handles, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is it used?\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrency: Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, which can lead to better performance in certain tasks, especially I/O-bound tasks (e.g., downloading files, reading/writing files, etc.).\n",
        "Improved Efficiency: Multithreading allows for better CPU utilization, particularly for I/O-bound operations, even though Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits multi-core performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "Module Used: The threading module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides high-level functions and classes for managing and working with threads.\n",

        "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved performance: For I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading from a file or network), multithreading allows one thread to run while another is waiting, making better use of the system's resources.\n",
        "Better CPU Utilization: When the task is I/O bound, multithreading helps in utilizing idle time of CPU effectively.\n",
        "Concurrent Task Execution: Multiple tasks can run in parallel, improving the responsiveness of an application (e.g., web servers).\n",
        "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
        "\n",
        "Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity, such as race conditions and deadlocks, which need proper synchronization.\n",
        "Overhead: Thread management incurs overhead in terms of memory usage and CPU cycles, especially when there are too many threads.\n",
        "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In CPython (the standard Python interpreter), the GIL prevents multiple threads from executing bytecode in parallel. This means that CPU-bound tasks do not benefit from multithreading in Python, as only one thread can execute at a time.\n",
        "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
        "Deadlocks: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release a resource. In a deadlock situation, none of the threads can proceed because they are all waiting for each other.\n",

        "Race Conditions: A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data and try to modify it simultaneously, resulting in unpredictable outcomes. This happens when the program’s behavior depends on the non-deterministic order of thread execution.\n",
