        "Q1: What are the different data structures used in TensorFlow? Give some examples.\n",
        "TensorFlow uses several core data structures to represent and manipulate data. Some of the key data structures in TensorFlow are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Tensors:\n",
        "Tensors are the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow, representing multi-dimensional arrays (similar to NumPy arrays).\n",
        "Tensors can have any number of dimensions (scalar, vector, matrix, or higher-dimensional arrays).\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "Scalar: tf.constant(5)\n",
        "Vector: tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
        "Matrix: tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
        "Variables:\n",
        "Variables in TensorFlow are used to represent modifiable state in the graph. They are similar to tensors but allow updates during training.\n",
        "A variable holds a tensor and allows operations to modify its value during training (like weights in neural networks).\n",
        "Example: tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.zeros([2, 3]))\n",
        "Constants:\n",
        "Constants are fixed values in TensorFlow. Once defined, their values cannot be changed during graph execution.\n",
        "Example: tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
        "Placeholders:\n",
        "Placeholders are used to feed data into a model during runtime. In TensorFlow 2.x, tf.function and tf.data API are typically used instead of placeholders.\n",
        "Example (TensorFlow 1.x style):\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None, 3])\n",
        "Datasets:\n",
        "The tf.data API is used for building complex input pipelines by reading data from different sources (like CSV files, image datasets, etc.) and performing transformations like shuffling and batching.\n",
        "Example: dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)\n",
        "Q2: How does the TensorFlow constant differ from a TensorFlow variable? Explain with an example.\n",
        "The main difference between a TensorFlow constant and a TensorFlow variable is their mutability:\n",
        "\n",
        "TensorFlow Constant (tf.constant):\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable: Once the value is assigned, it cannot be changed.\n",
