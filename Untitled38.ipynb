It works by training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the training data and then combining their individual predictions to provide a more accurate and stable output. Unlike a single decision tree that may overfit the data, a random forest reduces the risk of overfitting by averaging multiple trees.\n",

        "Random Forest Regressor reduces overfitting in two key ways:\n",

        "Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging): It uses bootstrapped datasets (i.e., random subsets of the training data) to train each decision tree. This helps ensure that individual trees do not overly memorize (overfit) the training data.\n",
        "Random Feature Selection: Each decision tree in a random forest is trained with a random subset of features (rather than all features). This prevents individual trees from becoming too correlated, leading to better generalization.\n",
        "By aggregating the predictions of multiple trees, Random Forest ensures that the model generalizes better to new, unseen data, rather than fitting noise or specific patterns in the training data.\n",

        "min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. A higher value can prevent overfitting by limiting tree depth.\n",
        "min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A higher value ensures that leaf nodes contain more data points, preventing overfitting.\n",
        "max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split. Using fewer features can make the model faster and reduce the likelihood of overfitting.\n",
        "bootstrap: Whether to use bootstrap samples when building trees. If False, the whole dataset is used to build each tree.\n",

        "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
        "The main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Number of Trees: A Decision Tree Regressor uses only one tree for making predictions, while a Random Forest Regressor uses multiple trees.\n",
        "Overfitting: A single decision tree tends to overfit the training data, especially with deep trees. In contrast, Random Forest mitigates overfitting by averaging predictions from multiple trees, leading to better generalization.\n",
        "Performance: Random Forest generally provides better performance (accuracy, stability) compared to a single decision tree because it reduces variance.\n",
        "Prediction: Decision Tree Regressor makes predictions based on a single path in one tree, while Random Forest Regressor makes predictions based on the collective decisions of multiple trees, usually resulting in a more accurate prediction.\n",
        "Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "High Accuracy: Random Forest Regressor generally provides a very high level of accuracy and is robust against overfitting.\n",
        "Handles Missing Data: Random Forest can handle missing values in the dataset.\n",
        "Robust to Noise: By averaging predictions from multiple trees, Random Forest is less sensitive to noise and outliers.\n",
        "Feature Importance: Random Forest can provide insights into which features are important for making predictions.\n",
        "Versatile: It can be used for both regression and classification tasks.\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "Computationally Expensive: Training many trees requires a lot of memory and processing power.\n",
        "Interpretability: While decision trees are interpretable, Random Forest with many trees can be challenging to interpret, making it less suitable for problems requiring model explainability.\n",
        "Slower Predictions: Predictions in Random Forest can be slower compared to a single decision tree, as it requires aggregating results from multiple trees.\n",
        "Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
        "The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numerical value, which is the average of the predictions made by all individual trees in the forest. This output can represent any continuous variable, such as house prices, stock prices, or any other regression task.\n",

        "Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
