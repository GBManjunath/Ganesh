        "C) Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence refers to the field of computer science that focuses on creating machines or systems that can simulate human intelligence. AI systems aim to perform tasks such as decision-making, problem-solving, learning, and language processing.\n",

        "Example: A chatbot that understands user queries and responds in natural language is an example of AI. Siri and Google Assistant are real-life examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "D) Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A recommendation system like Netflix suggesting movies based on user preferences uses machine learning. The system learns from user interactions and improves recommendations over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "E) Deep Learning (DL): Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks to model complex patterns in large datasets. It’s particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",

        "Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
        "Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The algorithm learns to map input data to the correct output by using this labeled dataset. The goal is to make predictions or classifications based on the input-output relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Supervised Learning:\n",

        "Image Classification: Classifying images into categories like dogs, cats, or cars based on labeled image data.\n",
        "Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
        "Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the data without predefined labels.\n",

        "Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
        "Supervised Learning: The model is trained with labeled data (input-output pairs). It learns to predict the output from the given input.\n",
