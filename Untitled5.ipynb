        "In Python, all exceptions, including custom ones, need to inherit from the Exception class because it is the base class for all built-in exceptions. When we create a custom exception, we subclass Exception to ensure that our custom exception integrates properly with Python's exception handling system, allowing it to be raised, caught, and handled appropriately using try-except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "By inheriting from the Exception class:\n",
        "\n",
        "We ensure that our custom exception behaves like any other built-in exception.\n",
        "We can catch and handle it using standard exception handling mechanisms.\n",
        "It gives us access to useful methods and attributes, such as __str__() and __repr__(), for error messages and debugging.\n",
