        "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
        "Class: A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. A class doesn't occupy memory until an object is created from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is created based on the class blueprint and contains real values for the attributes defined in the class. An object can access the methods and attributes defined within its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "# Defining a class named 'Car'\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",

        "# Creating objects of the class 'Car'\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",

        "# Accessing the method of the objects\n",
        "car1.display_info()  # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla\n",
        "car2.display_info()  # Output: 2021 Honda Civic\n",
        "In this example, Car is the class, and car1 and car2 are objects created from the Car class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
        "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components to ensure the objectâ€™s integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Hiding the complexity of the system and exposing only the essential details to the user. It allows focusing on high-level mechanisms without delving into the intricate workings of the class or method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class, allowing for code reuse and extending functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: The ability to take on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows methods to be used in different ways depending on the object or class type. It supports method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
        "__init__() Function: The __init__() function is a special method in Python, known as a constructor, that is automatically called when a new object (instance) of a class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class and set initial values for the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
        "        self.name = name  # Initialize the 'name' attribute\n",
        "        self.breed = breed  # Initialize the 'breed' attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.name} is barking!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object of the Dog class\n",
        "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
        "dog1.bark()  # Output: Buddy is barking!\n",
        "In this example, the __init__() function initializes the name and breed attributes when a new Dog object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
        "self: In Python, self refers to the instance of the class. It is a way to access the attributes and methods of the class from within the class itself. self is used to represent the instance of the class in its methods, and it allows each object to keep track of its own attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is not a keyword but a convention. You could technically use another name, but self is the widely accepted convention.\n",
        "self allows different objects of the same class to have different values for their attributes.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name  # 'self' allows each object to have its own attributes\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating objects with different attributes\n",
        "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
        "\n",
        "person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n",
        "person2.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.\n",
        "In this example, self refers to the individual objects (person1, person2) and allows each object to store its own name and age.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
        "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a class (called a child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent class or superclass). This enables code reuse and the creation of more specialized versions of a base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of inheritance:\n",
