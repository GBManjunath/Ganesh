        "Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel: This kernel is effective for data that is not linearly separable and captures non-linear relationships.\n",
        "Effect on performance: The correct kernel should match the underlying data distribution. The wrong choice might lead to overfitting or underfitting.\n",

        "The C parameter controls the trade-off between achieving a low error on the training data and minimizing the model complexity.\n",

        "4. Gamma Parameter:\n",
        "The gamma parameter defines how far the influence of a single training point reaches in the kernel space. It is especially important when using non-linear kernels like RBF.\n",
        "Large gamma: The model will have high variance and overfit (data points influence only their nearby neighbors).\n",
        "Small gamma: The model is more generalized and underfits (data points influence the entire feature space).\n",
