        "Estimation Statistics refers to the process of inferring the value of a population parameter (like the mean, standard deviation, etc.) based on sample data. It involves the use of sample statistics to estimate the corresponding population parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Point Estimate: A point estimate provides a single value estimate of a population parameter. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean. It gives an exact value, but it doesn't account for variability or uncertainty in the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval Estimate: An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the population parameter is expected to lie. The range is defined by a confidence interval, which is usually associated with a confidence level (e.g., 95% confidence interval). This type of estimate accounts for the variability and provides a more robust estimation.\n",
