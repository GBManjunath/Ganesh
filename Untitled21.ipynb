        "The Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking a particular value. It is the continuous counterpart to the probability mass function (PMF) used for discrete distributions. The PDF is a function that, when integrated over an interval, gives the probability that a random variable falls within that interval. For a continuous distribution, the probability of the variable taking any exact value is technically zero, but the area under the curve between two values represents the probability.\n",
