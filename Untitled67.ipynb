        "1. Fundamental Idea Behind YOLO (You Only Look Once)\n",
        "YOLO is a real-time object detection framework that aims to simplify the object detection process by treating it as a single regression problem, where both object localization (bounding boxes) and classification (labels) are predicted simultaneously in one pass of the neural network. Instead of using a sliding window approach or multiple passes over the image, YOLO makes predictions for all objects in an image with a single forward pass through the network, achieving faster detection speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Difference Between YOLO V1 and Traditional Sliding Window Approaches\n",
        "Traditional sliding window approaches involve moving a fixed-size window over an image and performing classification at each location. This process is computationally expensive, as the classifier must be applied multiple times for each position in the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, YOLO V1 divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell simultaneously. This eliminates the need for redundant computations and allows YOLO to detect multiple objects in one pass. YOLO V1 is significantly faster because it performs detection in a single forward pass of the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How YOLO V1 Predicts Bounding Box Coordinates and Class Probabilities\n",
        "In YOLO V1, the model divides the image into an\n",
        "�\n",
        "×\n",
        "�\n",
        "S×S grid, and each grid cell is responsible for predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities. For each grid cell:\n",
        "\n",
        "Bounding box prediction: Each grid cell predicts 5 values — 4 coordinates (x, y, width, height) and a confidence score that reflects the certainty of whether a bounding box exists.\n",
        "Class probabilities: For each grid cell, the model also predicts the conditional probability distribution of the object classes. These probabilities are multiplied by the confidence score to give the final likelihood of the class being present in the bounding box.\n",
        "4. Advantages of Using Anchor Boxes in YOLO V2\n",
        "Anchor boxes in YOLO V2 are predefined bounding box shapes of different aspect ratios and sizes, which help the model better predict the location of objects. The advantages include:\n",
