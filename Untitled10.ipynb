        "GET and POST are the most common HTTP methods used for communication between the client (usually a browser or API client) and the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "GET Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "Used to retrieve data from the server.\n",
        "The data is sent as part of the URL (in the query string) and is visible in the browser's address bar.\n",
        "GET requests are idempotent, meaning that repeating the same request will produce the same result.\n",
        "Used for requests that do not modify any data (e.g., fetching a webpage or an image).\n",
        "Limited by the length of the URL.\n",
        "Example: Requesting a webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "http\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "GET /home?user=JohnDoe&age=25\n",
        "POST Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "Used to send data to the server to be processed, such as submitting a form.\n",
        "Data is sent in the body of the request, making it invisible in the URL.\n",
        "POST requests are not idempotent, meaning that repeating the request may result in different outcomes (e.g., submitting the same form multiple times).\n",
        "POST is typically used when data needs to be created or updated on the server (e.g., submitting login credentials or creating a new user).\n",
        "Example: Submitting a form to register a user.\n",
        "\n",
        "http\n",

        "Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
        "In Flask, request is an object that contains all the information about the incoming HTTP request. It provides access to the request data (such as form data, query parameters, cookies, etc.), the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common use cases for request:\n",
        "\n",
        "Access form data: Retrieve data submitted through forms.\n",
        "Access query parameters: Retrieve data sent in the URL, such as ?name=John.\n",
        "Access request headers: Read custom headers from the request.\n",
        "Handle JSON: Parse JSON data in the request body, often used in APIs.\n",
        "Example of using request to handle form data:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "from flask import Flask, request\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

        "Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask?\n",
        "The redirect() function in Flask is used to redirect the user to a different URL. It sends an HTTP response with a 302 status code and a \"Location\" header, which tells the browser where to navigate next.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common use cases for redirect():\n",
        "\n",
        "After a successful form submission or login, redirect the user to another page (e.g., a dashboard or home page).\n",
        "Handle user authentication and redirect based on conditions (e.g., if a user is not logged in, redirect them to a login page).\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "Copy code\n",

        "In this case, visiting /login will redirect to /.\n",

        "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
        "In Flask, templates are HTML files that are used to dynamically generate web pages by combining static content with dynamic data. Flask uses Jinja2 as the default templating engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Templates allow you to:\n",
        "Embed dynamic content within static HTML.\n",
        "Use variables, loops, and conditionals to create flexible HTML pages.\n",
        "Separate the HTML structure from Python logic (following the MVC pattern).\n",
        "The render_template() function is used to render an HTML template with dynamic data passed from the Python code. This function loads a template and returns it as an HTTP response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
