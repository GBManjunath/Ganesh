        "Seaborn is a powerful Python library for data visualization built on top of Matplotlib. It provides several plot types that are easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing than the standard Matplotlib plots. Here are five commonly used plots in Seaborn and their uses:\n",
        "\n",
        "Line Plot (sns.lineplot)\n",
        "\n",
        "Use: Line plots are used to visualize data points in a time series or any other ordered data. It is used to identify trends and patterns over a continuous domain (e.g., time).\n",
        "Box Plot (sns.boxplot)\n",
        "\n",
        "Use: Box plots display the distribution of a dataset through quartiles. It highlights the median, upper, and lower quartiles, as well as potential outliers. It's useful for comparing distributions across categories.\n",
        "Histogram (sns.histplot)\n",
        "\n",
        "Use: Histograms are used to display the distribution of a single numerical variable. They are useful for understanding the frequency distribution of a continuous variable.\n",
        "Heatmap (sns.heatmap)\n",
        "\n",
        "Use: Heatmaps are used to visualize the matrix of data where the individual values are represented by the color of the grid cells. This is helpful in understanding correlations or relationships between different variables.\n",
        "Pair Plot (sns.pairplot)\n",
        "\n",
        "Use: Pair plots are used to visualize pairwise relationships between multiple variables in a dataset. It’s useful for understanding how variables correlate with each other and for detecting patterns.\n",
