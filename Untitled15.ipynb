        "Matplotlib is a popular Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It is particularly useful for plotting data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating publication-quality charts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Matplotlib's Pyplot module provides an interface for creating different types of plots. Some of the most commonly used plots that can be created with Pyplot are:\n",

        "Scatter Plot\n",

        "These plots help visualize data distributions, trends, and relationships between variables in a simple and understandable way.\n",

        "Q2: What is a scatter plot? Use the following code to generate data for x and y. Using this generated data plot a scatter plot.\n",
        "A scatter plot is a type of data visualization where each data point is represented as a dot on a 2D plane. The position of each dot corresponds to the values of two variables (one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis). It is used to visually represent the correlation or relationship between the two variables.\n",

        "The subplot() function in Matplotlib is used to create multiple plots in a single figure. It allows you to define the layout of subplots in a grid. The function takes three parameters: the number of rows, the number of columns, and the index of the current subplot (starting from 1).\n",
